Neural Network For Collision Prediction- collect training data for a robotics task and, in turn, design a neural network that can process this data. Overall the goal is to help a small robot navigate a simulated environment without any collisions.
<br>
<br>
<b>Part 1:</b>
<br>
Collect data that can be used to train the model.
<br>
<br>
<b>Part 2:</b>
<br>
Increase training set and package it into an iterable PyTorch DataLoader for ease of use.
<br>
<br>
<b>Part 3:</b>
<br>
Designing a custom neural network using PyTorchâ€™s torch.nn class
<br>
<br>
<b>Part 4:</b>
<br>
Train a model using the custom network architecture, which accurately predicts collisions given sensor and action information.
